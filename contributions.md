### Florian Pfisterer

Florian Pfisterer implemented and extended the main part of the package, heavily influcenced by
a unpublished python code-base written in large parts by Mathew. Florian furthermore worked on the interaction with
**mlr3** by integrating **mlr3** learners as Auditing Mechanism as well as exporting functionality to integrate
**mcboost** as a `PipeOp` into **mlr3pipelines**.
