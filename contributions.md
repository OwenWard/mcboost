### Florian Pfisterer

Florian Pfisterer implemented and extended the main part of the package, heavily influcenced by
a unpublished python code-base written in large parts by Matthew. Florian furthermore worked on the interaction with
**mlr3** by integrating **mlr3** learners as Auditing Mechanism as well as exporting functionality to integrate
**mcboost** as a `PipeOp` into **mlr3pipelines**.

### Christoph Kern

Christoph Kern prepared and contributed to the vignettes and co-authored the summary paper. Christoph contributed (very) moderately to the python code underlying this package and helped conceptionally in transitioning from the python code to the R implementation.

### Susanne Dandl

Susanne Dandl reviewed the R package, she provided advice on extensions, extended and improved vignettes
and worked towards thorough unit testing of the different methods.

### Matthew Sun

Matthew Sun wrote the initial Python implementation of MCBoost, with feedback and oversight provided by Michael.

### Michael P. Kim

Michael P. Kim is a coauthor of the research papers that introduced Multi-Calibration.
Michael oversaw the development of the initial python implementation of MCBoost
and provided additional advice in the development of this R package.

### Bernd Bischl

Oversaw the package development and provided feedback with respect to API design, implementation details and methodology.
