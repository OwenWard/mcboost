Description: Implements "multi-calibration" (Hebert Johnson et al., 2018) and
    multi-accuracy boosting (Kim et al., 2019) for calibration of a machine learning model's prediction.
    MCBoost is a technique, that iteratively updates predictions for  sub-groups in order to mitigate biases
    like poor calibration or large accuracy differences across subgroups.
    Multi-calibration works best in scenarios where the underlying data & labels is un-biased
    but a bias is introduced within the algoritm's fitting procedure. This is often the case,
    e.g. when an algorithm fits a majority sub-population while ignoring or under-fitting minority populations.
